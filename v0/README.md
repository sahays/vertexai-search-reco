# Vertex AI Search for Media

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search for Media. It is
designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and utilizing media-specific search and recommendation engines.

The tool is split into two main components:

- **Media Data Store**: Manages the data lifecycle, including validation, transformation, and ingestion into Vertex AI
  data stores.
- **Media Engine**: Manages the search and recommendation engines that serve queries and suggestions.

## Documentation

For detailed information on each component, please refer to their respective `README.md` files:

- [**Media Data Store**](./src/media_data_store/README.md): Learn how to prepare and manage your media data for Vertex
  AI Search.
- [**Media Engine**](./src/media_engine/README.md): Learn how to create and manage search and recommendation engines.
